# V6 Black Hole Membrane Universe Simulator
A 2D N-body physics simulation engine designed to explore the self-consistency of **Black Hole Cosmology** and **Membrane Boundary Theory**.
## 🚀 Overview
This project simulates a universe contained within a spherical boundary (the "Membrane"). It incorporates gravitational binding, thermal equilibrium, atmospheric chemistry, and external mass injection as an analog for Dark Energy.
## 🔬 Core Features
- **Membrane Physics:** Tidal damage and time dilation effects near the event horizon.
- **Atmospheric Evolution:** Dynamic oxygen/nitrogen generation based on planetary mass and temperature.
- **Verification Suite:** 8-point scientific validation (T1-T8) including mass conservation and expansion dynamics.
- **Gaia Biosphere Analysis:** Classification of planets into Gaia, Ocean, Scorched, or Barren worlds.
## 📂 Project Structure
- `c.py`: The high-performance Physics Kernel (V6).
- `d.py`: Scientific Verifier and Data Analyzer.
- `run_v6.py`: Main entry point for Epoch-based simulation.
- `RESULT.txt`: Final output report and physics summary.
## 📊 Quick Start
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
3. python run_v6.py
   Check the universe_saves directory for JSON snapshots and the final report.
